Not released on CRAN.

Added support for many more ways of specifying deg2dms outputs, e.g. 2d34m45.5s and 2:34:45.5. Code can also take string versions of HMS and DMS coordinates and convert them back to degrees.

v1.2

Added cosmological distance calculator and a sky area calculator.

v1.3 (not on CRAN)

Added individual cosmology routines as separate functions.

Added new cosgrow (structure growth) and cosmap (generic parameter inputs, not just redshift) functions.
