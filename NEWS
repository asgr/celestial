v1.0

Not released on CRAN.

v1.1

FEATURE: Added support for many more ways of specifying deg2dms outputs, e.g. 2d34m45.5s and 2:34:45.5. Code can also take string versions of HMS and DMS coordinates and convert them back to degrees.

v1.2

FEATURE: Added cosmological distance calculator and a sky area calculator.

v1.3 (CRAN)

FEATURE: Added individual cosmology routines as separate functions.

FEATURE: Added new cosgrow (structure growth) and cosmap (generic parameter inputs, not just redshift) functions.

FEATURE: Added sky coordinate matching functionality (coordmatch)

v1.4 (not on CRAN)

FEATURE: Added cosvararea function, which is a simpler interface to cosvarsph where the assumption is aside=bside.

FEATURE: Added cosgrowRhoMean function, which is the mean matter density as a given redshift

FIXED: cosgrow RhoCrit column had a bug that meant it scaled by H(z) not H(z)^2 (cosgrowRhoCrit had no bug).

DOCS: Fixed a couple of document issues
