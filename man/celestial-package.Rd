There are a number of functions included, but the most useful for astronomy conversions are the decimal degrees to DMS/HMS formats used at many telescopes: deg2dms, deg2hms, dms2deg, hms2deg. It also contains functions for various cosmological calculations (i.e. distance, volume and age for different cosmologies and redshifts).
